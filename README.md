# Amazon


An Amazon app clone using HTML and CSS is a simplified version of the popular e-commerce platform, designed to display products and provide easy navigation for users.

Key Features:
Navigation Bar:

A sticky top navbar featuring the Amazon logo, a search bar, cart icon, and user account options. It is styled using CSS flexbox to align elements and ensure responsiveness.
Product Listings:

A grid of product cards, each showing a product image, name, price, and an “Add to Cart” button. The grid is built using CSS grid (grid-template-columns) for a responsive layout that adjusts across devices.
Product Details:

Each product card links to a product detail page, which is styled with larger images, product descriptions, and reviews, using HTML structure and CSS for typography and layout.
Footer:

A footer section with links to customer service, shipping details, and company information, styled using CSS with a dark background and light text for contrast.
Design:
Colors: The app uses Amazon’s signature colors—orange (#FF9900) for buttons and dark blue (#131A22) for the header.
Responsiveness: CSS media queries ensure the layout adapts for mobile, tablet, and desktop, making the site user-friendly across devices.
This project provides a basic yet functional e-commerce interface, highlighting Amazon's core features using HTML and CSS.
